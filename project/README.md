# Project: Automobile company
# Course: Databases

Enterprise description:
The application is an automobile company, such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota, or Volkswagen
(or maybe a company from yesteryear like Studebaker, Hudson, Nash, or Packard). In our
hypothetical company, it has been decided to redesign a major part of the database that underlies
company operations. Unfortunately, the manager assigned to solicit database design proposals is not
very computer literate and is unable to provide a very detailed specification at the technical level.
Fortunately, you are able to do that. The company needs to keep quite a bit of data, but we shall
focus on the following aspects of corporate operations.

1. E-R Model
2. Relational Model
3. Populate Relations
4. Queries
