It is not always possible to achieve both BCNF and
dependency preservation
 Consider a schema:
dept_advisor(s_ID, i_ID, department_name)
 With function dependencies:
i_ID → dept_name
s_ID, dept_name → i_ID
 dept_advisor is not in BCNF
• i_ID is not a superkey.
 Any decomposition of dept_advisor will not include all the
attributes in
s_ID, dept_name → i_ID
 Thus, the composition is NOT be dependency preserving
