Large objects (photos, videos, CAD files, etc.) are stored as
a large object:
• blob: binary large object -- object is a large collection of
uninterpreted binary data (whose interpretation is left to
an application outside of the database system)
• clob: character large object -- object is a large collection
of character data
 When a query returns a large object, a pointer is returned
rather than the large object itself.
