Privileges control the ability to run SQL statements. 
A role is a group of privileges. 
Granting a role to a user gives them the privileges contained in the role.

Granting a privilege on a view does not imply granting any
privileges on the underlying relations.
 The grantor of the privilege must already hold the privilege
on the specified item (or be the database administrator).

A role is a way to distinguish among various users as far
as what these users can access/update in the database.

Once a role is created we can assign “users” to the role.
