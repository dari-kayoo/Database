Function:
It is one among the fundamental thought in the computer programming. It is used to calculate something from a given input. 
Hence it got its name from Mathematics. Function can be either user defined or predefined. 
The function program has a block of code that performs some specific tasks or functions.

Procedure:
In programming a particular set of instructions or commands along known as a procedure. 
Counting on the programming language it is known as as procedure, subroutine, function or a subprogram.

Difference between Function and Procedure:
1.	A function deals with as an expression.	Whereas a procedure does not deal with as an expression.
2.	Function is used to calculate something from a given input. Hence it got its name from Mathematics.	
While procedure is the set of commands, which are executed in a order.
3.	The function can be called by a procedure.	But a procedure can not be called by a function.
4.	In sql, inside the function we can not use the DML(Data manipulation language) commands such as Insert, Delete, Update.	
Here, in sql, inside the procedure we can use DML commands.
5.	Functions can be called through sql queries.	However, the procedure can’t be called through a sql query.
6.	Each time functions are compiled when they are called.	
Whereas, procedures are compiled only once and can be called again and again as needed without being compiled each time.
7.	The return statement of a function returns the control and function’s result value to the calling program.	
While the return statement of the procedure returns control to the calling program, it can not return the result value.
8.	Function doesn’t support try-catch blocks.	While it supports try-catch blocks.
9.	Function can be operated in the SELECT statement.	While it can’t be operated in the SELECT statement.
10.	Function does not support explicit transaction handles.	While procedure supports explicit transaction handles.
